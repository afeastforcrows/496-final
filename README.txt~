README:

Controls for the program are as follows:
	shift+mouse: trackball movement
	b: toggle rendering the bounding volumes
	i: print a help message
	q/esc: quit
	r: reset camera orientation to default state (bugged)
	w, a, s, d: rotate the selected model (bugged)
	arrow keys: moves the camera forward, backward, to the left and to the right
	t, f, g, h: translate the selected model

Known bugs:
	-The 'R' key briefly resets the camera viwe, but the change is not permanent and will revert when the camera is moved again
	-When rotating individual models, they rotate about an axis that does not cross their center

Ply models used in this project were taken from:
